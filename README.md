# DesktopJokes
This application allows you to add small jokes to your desktop that will change after a specific interval.

Once launched, the icon will appear in the icon tray (bottom right) of your task bar. No window will open on launch. Right click on that icon to gain access to the following options:

- Change joke... // This will change the joke on the desktop, however the timer will not reset.
- Change interval... // This will allow you to change the interval in ms.
- Exit // This will kill the program.
